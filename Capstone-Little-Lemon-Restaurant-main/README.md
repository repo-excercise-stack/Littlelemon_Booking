# Capstone-Little-Lemon-Restaurant
A Capstone Project for the Meta Front End Developer Course. 

This project aims to demonstrate an understanding of the fundementals of React and Software Design, learned through the Meta Front End Developer course.  

In this project, I have designed and built a web application for a fictional restaurant called Little Lemon, which includes a table booking system. 


# Scenario
Little Lemon has faced difficulties with the reserve-a-table feature on its website. The feature doesnâ€™t exist in the navigation bar and there is no specific button on its homepage to highlight this option. 

# Notes
In my Booking form, I have included custom built components to keep my code clean and to demonstrate re-usability 
The real API provided by the course did not work, and so I built a FakeAPI function to simulate the API behaviour
